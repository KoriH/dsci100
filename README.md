# Raisin Identifyer Project for DSCI 100

The goal of this project is to identify the type of raisin given its physical dimensions. This was acheived through a K-nearst neighbour classification algorithm done in R. 

The project achieved its goal of predicting the type of raisin with about an 85% accuracy rate when tested.

This project was done as a group with: Kori H, Radman T, Hailey H, and Marcus L.
